#While working on textual data, there are few types which I have dealed with. The first type was UTF-8, this the best file type as working on this type is realy easy and every line of code works properly on this formate.
#Seciund form is UTF-16LE, it needed to be converted, so for convertion we can use "ICONV".
Code: iconv -f UTF-16LE -t UTF-8 peresent_file.txt >  new_file.txt
